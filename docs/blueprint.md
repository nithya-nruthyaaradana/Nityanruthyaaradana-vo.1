## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted saffron (#D4A373), to evoke the traditional and spiritual aspects of Indian dance. 
- Background color: A light, desaturated beige (#F5F5DC), providing a calm and unobtrusive backdrop that keeps the focus on the dance institute's content.
- Accent color: A desaturated brick red (#B46A5D) to complement the saffron, and bring visual interest to key UI elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Literata', a serif font to enhance the site's literary, slightly vintage, and formal aesthetic.
- Use simple, elegant line icons representing dance postures and classical Indian motifs.
- Employ a grid-based layout with generous whitespace for a clean, uncluttered design.
- Use subtle, tasteful animations to suggest the art of dance. For example, have photos subtly crossfade.
